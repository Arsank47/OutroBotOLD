# OutroBot
A python based discord bot that triggers a sound and disconnects users on a random basis on beat!


These are all the commands that you can use to trigger the bot to perform various different tasks:

    "!outrohelp": "Display the available commands.",
    "!outro": "Play the outrobot but disconnect users at a normal pace.",
    "!outroshort": "Play the outrobot but disconnect users at a faster pace.",
    "!outrolong": "Play the outrobot but disconnect users at a slower pace WITH A SURPRISE ;)",
    "!outrogame": "Ask the bot minimum two questions or games and the bot will pick a random option.",
    "!outrotest": "Use this command to test whether the bot is working.",
    "!outropause": "Pause the bot however this is an experimental feature and does not work properly.",
    "!outroresume": "Resumes the bot if paused, however this is an experimental feature and does not work properly.",
    "!outrorequest": "Allows the user to add a feature request of maximum of 200 words",
    "how to delete a outrorequest?": "sed -i '/^12345:/d' user_requests.txt OR sed -i `'/^Username: <discord username>:/d' user_request.txt",
    "!outrolistrequests": "This will list all of the current requests that have been recorded",
